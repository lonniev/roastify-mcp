// Entertaining loading screen — rotating quotes from the greats of copywriting,
// advertising, and brevity (on-brand for a posting tool), so a wait reads as
// "we're working" instead of a frozen "Loading…". Modeled on Optionality's
// QuoteScroller, but Tailwind/dark and dependency-free: the quotes are inline so
// the loading screen can never itself fail on a network hiccup. The optional
// `heading` doubles as a status line ("Opening the editor…").
